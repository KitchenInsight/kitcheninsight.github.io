I’m a physicist by training. I’m working as a development engineer in semiconductor industry – dealing with wafer data generated by various machines in a fab.

At home, I enjoy cooking.

The combination of semiconductor fab and food is by now not surprising any more I guess, after they started [growing vegetables in a former fab at Toshiba](http://qz.com/295936/toshibas-high-tech-grow-rooms-are-churning-out-lettuce-that-never-needs-washing/). After all, there are great resemblance between a modern green house and a fab.

In fact, cooking is a highly scientific thing. It’s highly complex and interdisciplinary – mixing physics, thermodynamics, chemistry, biology, psychology, etc. At the same time, it’s full of myth, probably because of its long history and accessibility – everyone can have a say on what is good cooking.

I enjoy very much learning the science of cooking. There are less scientific rules in the kitchen than there are myths. So the practical benefit is to simplify life as a home cook.

Kitchen Insight is therefore the place to share learnings.
